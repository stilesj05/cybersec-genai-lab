**Date:** June 8, 2025

---

## Project Overview

This project explores the use of generative AI models to solve real-world cybersecurity problems. Through hands-on exercises with Hugging Face models and Google Colab, we perform tasks such as penetration testing, policy comparison, vulnerability analysis, and threat detection. The project emphasizes reproducibility and ethical AI use.
